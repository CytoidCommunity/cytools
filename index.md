For experienced developers (referring to charters, storyboarders, software devs and so on), here's a list of tools for you.

## Tools for Charting

The charting experience may vary depending on your software of choice. So make sure you pick the right one before you get your hands on it.

### Cytunity

One of the most popular charting tools out there. Compared to other tools, Cytunity has a lot of advantages, and it's recommended for new charters to use.  
>### Pros
>1. Tabbed interface
>2. Click-to-create note instantiating method
>3. Easy-to-remember hotkeys
>4. Good visualization
>5. Realistic playback

>### Cons
>1. May cause bugs with linked notes
>2. Uses Cytus 1 format, which doesn't support changing the speed of the scanline
>3. Has 2 formats, one for reloading, the other for exporting as the official format, which can be confusing
